# Yet another ABS App

## yaabsa

An improved cross-platform app for Audiobookshelf

## Usage of AI

As I myself criticize the lack of disclosure about AI, which most ABS apps now use, I want to be clear that later in the making of the app, AI/LLMs were used in the development process. I still know the API endpoints used very well and have already helped a ton of people with API usage.

## Compatibility Matrix

> [!NOTE]
> For best playback experience merge all audio files into one file.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - ✅: Feature is available and tested for the platform before the release on at least one personal device.
> - ❓: Feature is available but not tested for the platform before the release. The features should work, but they are not guaranteed to work.
> - ❌: Feature is not available for the platform
> - 🅿️: Feature is planned for the platform, but not yet implemented.
> - L: Low priority feature.
>
> If a feature already has a 🅿️, ❓, or ✅ and ❌ for the other platforms for the same feature, it is not planned to be implemented, either because it is not possible or not worth the effort for a single platform. However, PRs will not be closed. Issues will
